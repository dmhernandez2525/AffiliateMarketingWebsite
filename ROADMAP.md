## Vision

**Affiliate Marketing Website** is a platform for managing affiliate marketing campaigns, tracking referral links, calculating commissions, and processing payouts. Currently only has a basic CRA scaffold - all affiliate functionality needs to be built.

## Phase Overview

- **Phase 1 (Core)**: Foundation and MVP scope
- **Phase 2 (Expansion)**: Feature depth and integrations
- **Phase 3 (Scale/Polish)**: Reliability, automation, and UX polish

## Success Criteria

- All features implemented with tests, lint, typecheck, and build passing
- Documentation updated for any architecture or workflow changes
- No forbidden patterns; follow global standards

## Risks & Dependencies

- External API limits, vendor dependencies, or platform constraints
- Cross-platform requirements (Mac/Windows) where applicable
